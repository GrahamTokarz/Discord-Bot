# Discord-Bot
A personal experimentation to learn postgresSQL in an interactive manner through the creation of a chat bot


This code was all self-created. This project has been a way for me to integrate my love of coding into a system that my friends and I use to communicate frequently, to learn how to use postgresSQL databases, and try to manage my coding in a more neat manner.
Although this is not the first discord bot that I have created, it was a good exercise for me to make the code cleaner, and to implement new systems.
